# GuessingGame

## Overview
**GuessingGame** is a simple and fun console application built with C#. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. The game provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low and tracks the number of guesses.

## Features

- Tracks the number of guesses
- Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)

- Limited number of guesses based on difficulty level
